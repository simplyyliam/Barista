# Checkpoint

Keep this file short: where we are, the next step, and facts a new session needs.
When a release ships, move its notes to `docs/release/history/` and start fresh.

## Where we are (2026-11-11)

- **v0.4.0 shipped** (tag `v0.4.0` on the merge of PR #19, not pushed yet: Liam runs `pnpm release`). Plan releases
  v0.0 to v0.4 are done; notes in `docs/release/history/` (local only, v0.4 in `v0.4-checkpoint.md`).
- **Next: v0.4b System panels** (`releases/v0.4b.md`, local only); it reuses `popover.rs`, `placement.rs` and `dismiss.rs`.
- ADR 0012 (tray) still needs Liam's approval before v0.6 starts.

## Facts a new session needs

- One Cargo workspace at the root (`apps/bar/src-tauri`, `crates/protocol`). `pnpm gen` = `cargo test --workspace export_`
  (writes `bindings.ts` and `protocol.ts`). specta crates are pinned exactly (ADR 0003). `CREDITS.md` needs a row for
  every new dependency (a test checks).
- shadcn lives in `packages/ui` (`@barista/ui`, preset `base-mira`); add components with
  `pnpm dlx shadcn@latest add <name> -c apps/bar`. Icons via `@barista/ui/icons` (`<Icon>`).
- Website: `apps/web` (Next.js 16 + Fumadocs, static export, ADR 0004). Docs search off until v0.10.
- UI already has: `getBarInfo`/`setMonitor`/`barChanged`, `getItems`/`itemClicked`/`itemsChanged`,
  `getWindowRadius`/`windowRadiusChanged` (+ `--window-radius`), `getBarAppearance`/`barAppearanceChanged` (+ `data-tone`).
- New for the UI (v0.3, not wired yet): window `menu` (loads `index.html`; App must render the menu there by window
  label), `menuOpen`/`menuChanged`/`menuClose`, `menuItemClicked`, `menuResized` (returns submenu side), `closeMenu`,
  `getOpenMenu`, `setItemBounds`.
- New windows: register with `window_radius::register(app, label, Mode::Tracked | Mode::Normal)` (popover = `Normal`), and
  create them with the same `additionalBrowserArgs` as `tauri.conf.json` (else WebView2 error 0x8007139F).
- `debug.listItems` / `debug.click` (and `pnpm inspect`) work in debug builds or with `BARISTA_DEBUG` set.
- Memory budget counts private memory (62 MB vs 120 MB); `--disable-gpu --renderer-process-limit=1` keeps it there.
- Driving the menu window without the UI: start `pnpm dev` with
  `WEBVIEW2_ADDITIONAL_BROWSER_ARGUMENTS=--remote-debugging-port=9222`, then evaluate JS in the `menu` / `main` page over
  CDP (`window.__TAURI_INTERNALS__.invoke(...)`). Debug only, never committed.
- `pnpm bench` refuses to run while a bar is running; it needs a release build. Since v0.3 it also times menus
  (`scripts/menu-visible.ps1` polls the menu window's visibility).
- Stopping `pnpm dev` from a background task leaves vite (port 1420) and a self-restarting bar behind: kill them by
  command line (`vite.js`, `target\debugarista.exe`) before starting again.
- Never set the real wallpaper in a test (it can't be restored); `wallpaper_live` only reads.

- New for the UI (v0.4, not wired yet): event `popoverChanged { itemId | null }` and command `getOpenPopover`: show the
  item as "open" while a popover is up. Item clicks already go through `itemClicked`: nothing else changes for the UI.
- Popovers: `popover.rs` (coordinator, one popover at a time, 1.5 s `popover.shown` timeout), `dismiss.rs` (the open/close
  Machine shared with menus), `placement.rs` (bar strip, work area, item rects), `platform/windows/foreground.rs`
  (`AllowSetForegroundWindow` + `SetWinEventHook(EVENT_SYSTEM_FOREGROUND)`). Click rule in `menu_window::route_click`.
- Testing popovers by hand: `debug.click` (and `pnpm inspect --click`) shows the window but can NOT give it focus (Windows
  needs real input). Use real clicks: `scripts/popover-latency.ps1` / `popover-visible.ps1`. Electron examples: run with
  `./node_modules/.bin/electron src/main.ts`; never `await app.whenReady()` at the top level of the main file (deadlock).
- Killing a dev bar: kill `barista.exe` by PID, then check port 1420 (vite); don't match processes by command line.

- Icon sizing (branch `fix/menubar-icon-sizing`, PR #17): the SDK sets an aspect-correct width and height on icon SVGs
  (16 x 16 square, about 25 x 12 for the battery). With Liam's OK, the string branch of `Icon` in
  `packages/ui/src/icons.tsx` now draws status images at that size (max height 22) instead of a fixed 16 x 16, in its own
  commit. Still open for Liam: the bar's own `battery.tsx` / `volume.tsx` (`size={16}` on 24-box Hugeicons) have the same
  empty-border problem.

## Fix next

- From dogfooding the v0.4 popovers: the open papercuts (Electron window helper, `closePopover()`, async `on("open")`,
  stale `popover.shown` token, `setPopover` resize while open) are in `docs/release/history/v0.4-checkpoint.md`.
  Menu latency sits at 42-46 ms against the 50 ms budget (WebView2 drift, see `docs/perf/0.4.md`).

- From dogfooding the focus timer (v0.3 menus):
  - Changing one entry (Start enabled, "Resume" label) means rebuilding the whole menu and calling `setMenu` again.
    Want `item.updateMenuItem(id, { enabled, label, checked })` or setters on `MenuItem` that sync by themselves.
  - `click(entry, { checked })`: `checked` is optional even for a checkbox, so apps write `checked ?? !x`.
    `entry.checked` is already mirrored; document that and maybe drop `checked` from the event.
  - Done in v0.4: `item.on("open")` runs right before a menu opens (the menu itself is already drawn, so a changed menu
    redraws a moment later).
  - `inspect` keys change every connection (`s22/timer`, `s48/timer`); accept `appName/itemId` too.
  - Accelerators are text only; "CmdOrCtrl+Enter" next to Start suggests a hotkey that doesn't exist. Say so in docs.
  - Fixed while dogfooding: role entries default their id to the role (`quit`), separators don't use up ids.

- Silent client (sends `hello`, then nothing) holds a connection slot until it disconnects: fixed by the v0.5 heartbeat.
- SDK papercuts from dogfooding `examples/clock`:
  - Accept raw SVG markup (`<svg...`) as `icon`, maybe a file-path helper.
  - No bar running = `connect()` rejects; needs wait/retry (v0.5), README should show try/catch until then.
  - `create()` resolves on send, not on accept (`limit_reached` arrives later as `error`); consider `await item.ready`.
  - README: say a label over 128 chars throws `TypeError`; mention `appName` in the quick start.
  - Done in v0.4: `item.on("click")` gives `anchor`; `item.on("open" | "close")` exists (menus and popovers).
- Not tested on real hardware: no monitor at launch (starts on a placeholder monitor).
